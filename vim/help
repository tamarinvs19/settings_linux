TCOMMENT

As operator (the prefix can be customized via |g:tcomment_opleader1|):

    gc{motion}   :: Toggle comments (for small comments within one line 
                    the &filetype_inline style will be used, if 
                    defined)
    gc<Count>c{motion} :: Toggle comment with count argument 
                    (see |tcomment#Comment()|)
    gcc          :: Toggle comment for the current line

Force line-wise operation:
    gC{motion}   :: Toggle comments by line
    gC<Count>c{motion} :: Toggle comment by line with count argument 
                    (see |tcomment#Comment()|)

Explicit commenting/uncommenting:

    g<{motion}   :: Uncomment region
    g<c          :: Uncomment the current line
    g<b          :: Uncomment the current region as block

    g>{motion}   :: Comment region
    g>c          :: Comment the current line
    g>b          :: Comment the current region as block

In visual mode:

    gc           :: Toggle comments
    g>           :: Comment selected text
